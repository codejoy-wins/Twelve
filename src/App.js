      <h2>Cloudland</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, in a land in the clouds, a princess was locked in a castle.



      Our hero, Elam, disembarked on a quest to save her.
      
      
      
      But she was guarded by 6 dragons.
      
      
      
      Msixes, Msicar, Aibohpomoh, and Ytinilucsamcixot swirled around the castle breathing fire.
      
      
      
      These dragons were the fiercest. and have devoured everyone who tried to save the Princess of the clouds.
      
      
      
      One dragon, Noitanimircsid, was the most intelligent. Noitanimircsid believed that the best defense was a good offense. This dragon operated in search and destroy mode, always devouring a new target in flames. Assuring no hero could even make it to the castle.
      
      
      
      The last Dragon was called Ecnarelot. And this dragon was so dangerous, so cunning, that people prayed to him each night. It is said in cloudland, that if you do not worship Ecnarelot, he will swallow you whole in your dreams and you will never wake up.
      
      
      
      Cloudland was not always this way. Only a decade ago, Elam Ahpla fell in love with the princess, before the Dragons had taken her away, and she loved him back. 
      
      
      
      Elam was 20 years old when she was taken from him by the Dragon, Ecnarelot in the night.
      
      
      
      For 7 years Elam and Cloudland were constantly under attack from Noitanimircsid.
      
      
      
      Until one day, Elam decided he was willing to risk his life to save the princess's. He stopped praying to Ecnarelot.
      
      
      
      At 27, he picked up his father's sword and crafted his own shield and began his quest to save her. 
      
      
      
      
      
      The path was long, winding, and confusing, but he persited.
      
      
      
      The path was narrow, perilous, and infused with darkness, but he perservered. 
      
      
      
      The path ahead was opaquely covered in dark clouds, but he pushed forward.
      
      
      
      The path was slippery and cursed, but he dared not turn back.
      
      
      
      Until finally, the castle could be seen in the distance, with several dragons swirling around it more and more fiercely as he got closer until...
      
      
      
      "Cease, at once, elam. It is I, Ytinilucsamcixot. I cannot let you pass."
      
      
      
      Elam staggered backward, but remembered that there was nothing back in cloudland for him unless he could bring back the princess with him. 
      
      
      
      He barked back, "I do not fear you, Ytinilucsamcixot , for you do not exist, but are rather a shade of existance," He threw his sword at the dragon with extreme speed.
      
      
      
      The dragon was hit by this, and retreated to the castle, hissing.
      
      
      
      
      
      Now Elam continued his trek, and could feel the castle getting closer, and the dragons swirling faster.
      
      
      
      Until suddenly, Msixes snuck up on him from behind.  
      
      
      
      "Elam, why do you come here?"
      
      
      
      "To save my princess." He replied.
      
      
      
      "She does not need to be saved by the likes of you," hissed the dragon. "If she wanted to leave, she can do that herself."
      
      
      
      "Then let me ask her myself." Elam spat back, readying his shield.
      
      
      
      Msixes spat a fireball at our hero, but our hero was not afraid. He deflected the fireball with his shield and as the dragon swirled around the path, Elam leapt off the narrow road, and landed on the dragon's back.
      
      
      
      Next, Elam pulled out a dagger and stabbed the dragon in the top of the neck, to which it shrieked and rolled Elam off him, but retreated to the castle.
      
      
      
      Elam fell and barely managed to catch himself on the edge of the narrow road, dangling. 
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Whilst dangling, yet another dragon came forth, this time with a booming voice.
      
      
      
      "Obey me" boomed Msicar.
      
      
      
      "Never."
      
      
      
      "Obedience is pleasure, resistance is pain" , said Msicar.
      
      
      
      "No, pleasure is me saving the princess and taking her back to cloudland where she belongs.", replied Elam, our hero.
      
      
      
      At this point Msicar summoned several demons with his eyes, and they all spawned ahead of Elam on the narrow road.
      
      
      
      
      
      Elam had no sword because he had thrown it at Ytinilucsamcixot. No dagger because he had stabbed it into the neck of Msixes. 
      
      
      
      But he still had his shield, so he deflected the incoming demonic hand to hand attacks. The demons were dark and short, with red eyes, and Elam shield bashed them off the edge of the narrow road, one by one until Msicar was furious and began breathing fire on the entire path.
      
      
      
      Elam jumped on top of the last demons head to avoid the flames, leapt into the air spinning 540 degrees and throwing his shield like a frisbee into the dragon's throat, where he choked and died right there, falling out of the sky. 
      
      
      
      Elam could hear cheers from deep below in cloudland, or maybe it was just his imagination. 
      
      
      
      He looked toward the castle, still distant, but much closer now. The sky changed colors to a dark red with thunder and lightning. The wounded dragons swirled faster and faster. 
      
      
      
      Aibohpomoh, an unharmed dragon, decided to bring another dragon with him after seeing Msicar fall so he telepathically summoned Noitanimircsid, the most offensive and most intelligent dragon, to attack Elam with him.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Elam had no shield, no sword, and no dagger, so he looked around for a hiding spot. There was none to be seen, and he could see the dragons gathering closer. So, he looked over the edge, underneath the path and noticed rungs.
      
      
      
      He transfered himself under the narrow road and swung himself from rung to rung, eyes fixed on the castle. 
      
      
      
      
      
      The two dragons could not see him because of the harsh weather they themselves had summoned. and they began attacking eachother in confusion. Both the dragons bit each others necks at the same time, and fell.
      
      
      
      
      
      Elam, seeing them fall, swung himself back onto the path and continued forward. 3 down, 3 to go. 2 of the remaing 3 dragons were wounded. But a wounded dragon's fire is twice as hot.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Ecnarelot suddenly spoke to Elam telepathically from the castle,
      
      
      
      "What do you seek?"
      
      
      
      "My princess".
      
      
      
      "Put on a gown, and call yourself princess, and you will have what you desire."
      
      
      
      "No, what I desire is both me as I am, and her as she is."
      
      
      
      
      
      " She doesn't want you"... hissed the dragon into Elam's mind.
      
      
      
      " I have to hear it from her." - returned Elam, and started sprinting toward the castle now. 
      
      
      
      The castle door was shot so Elam began scaling the building with dragons swirling around him. He was knocked off by the wounded Msixes, and managed to catch himself by the handle of the sword sticking out of Ytinilucsamcixot he had put there earlier.
      
      
      
      
      
      He pulled it out, and the beast died and dropped to a thousand depths below as Elam leapt off and began scaling the building with his sword remounted to his back. 
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Msixes made another pass at Elam but Elam cut his eyes out as he was flying by, and the beast fled the castle to the horizon. As he left, Elam, smiled at the beautiful sight of a dragon flying into the sunset.  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      He called out, "Princess!! "
      
      
      
      
      
      She popped out the window and looked beautiful, dressed in a silk pink gown, glimmering with dragon scales that bordered on transparency.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      At this point, Ecnarelot appeared. An absolute behemoth of a dragon. Larger than the other 5 combined.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      "TURN BACK NOW."
      
      
      
      "No." said Elam.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      " ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY ARE, EVEN IF YOU DO NOT LIKE IT "
      
      
      
      "As long as I have breath, I will not. " said Elam.
      
      
      
      
      
      "THEN I WILL TAKE YOUR BREATH" hissed Ecnarelot.
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Suddenly Elam Ahpla couldn't breath, and he dropped his sword and gasped for air. 
      
      
      
      The Princess, moved by his journey, jumped out the window and onto the dragons back. He was so Massive and powerful he did not feel her walk with such grace.
      
      
      
      
      
      She reached Elam, but he wasn't breathing, so she put her mouth onto his and breathed her air into him. 
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Elam awoke, sprung up, and dipped her like in a dance and began kissing her. The Dragon was furious. The sky turned dark purple. Ecnarelot turned completely black in hue, like a shadow. 
      
      
      
      
      
      "I cast you aside, Ecnarelot." said Elam, "The princess is with me now."
      
      
      
      
      
      And he began spinning around with the princess, like a dance. 
      
      
      
      Together they swung his sword at the dragon with amplified force. The dragon was hit, fled sourly, and Ecnarelot was no more. 
      
      
      
      Elam and his princess walked back to Cloudland, as the sound of cheering grew louder. 
      
      
      
      
      
      THE END

      <h2>Gender Pay Gap Philosophy</h2>
      <p>I'm going to attempt to clarify my position on why I defend the gender pay gap.

      I don't think it is the government's role to tell businesses what to pay their employees.
      
      If it is true that female workers are underpaid compared to their male counterparts in a specific domain, I believe that business would lose to a business that paid them fairly.
      
      For example, if you have the male engineers make 100K a year and only pay the women 65K for the same exact quality of work, then here's what I think would be able to happen.
      
      A new software company could spring up and take advantage of underpaid good engineers. They could offer the underpaid females higher money, say 90K. Now you have two companies, both equally skilled engineers. You have one company paying 100K per employee (all men) and another company hiring only women at 90K. Since there is no difference between their skills, the 90K business could afford to sell their products for cheaper, or pay more for advertisements and R&D.
      
      That is what I believe would start to happen if you actually had underpaid people because of arbitrary reasons like gender.
      
      Okay, so let's assume that people get paid what they are worth for the sake of argument. That means women are not as valuable workers to the company if you break down the statistics for this hypothetical company.
      
      Why might this be? How to explain that without asking the government to save you, and how to explain that without making gender stereotypes. We live in an over-sensitized world where you're calling me sexist. I'm not sexist. I'm making gross generalizations about potential explanations for the gender gap other than sexism. I think you are falsely attributing sexism as the cause of the gap, just as you are falsely accusing me of sexism now.
      
      I believe a better explanation than companies overpaying males is that males, for various reasons, tend to value money more and work harder for it.
      
      Let me give you a scientifically proven example. Some little boys like dolls and some little girls like hot wheels, but on average, boys like things like cars more than girls, whereas girls care more about people than inanimate objects. This puts us at a huge evolutionary advantage if we work together with the masculine and feminine.
      
      A gender pay gap has 2 potential explanations.
      
      a) The employers are sexist
      
      b) Genders provide different values
      
      So either you're calling someone a sexist, or you're the sexist. Right? No, it's not sexist to say genders provide different value at work. That would only be sexist if you assume both genders are trying equally. If they're both trying equally, but men are paid more, and the employers aren't sexist, that implies one gender is better than the other at the job, and that's what's got everyone so hot and bothered.
      
      In my opinion, the best explanation I can think of is that different genders have different values and therefore the performance reflects that. Women inherently have the gift of interpersonal relationships, and they may value spending time with the family, or having a healthy work-life balance more so than men, on average, thus explaining the difference in value produced at work. It doesn't have to be a competence issue. We can just call it a difference in priorities and therefore effort.
      
      In conclusion, let's please stop using sexism to talk about this issue. There shouldn't be anything derogatory about embracing the reality of traditional gender roles that are evolutionarily programmed into our reward systems. I don't care about equality of outcome; what I care about is equality of opportunity. If a gender is marginalized in their opportunity then I will listen to you, but I'm not in support of the government mandating I pay genders equally. I'd rather pay them what they're worth and let the chips fall where they may. Whatever happened to Martin Luther King, Jr? Let's not pay people by the their gender, color, or anything other than the content of their work. We can attempt to analyze data that way in search for answers, but when it comes to actual policy, don't tell me what to pay my employees, and don't call me sexist.</p>

    <h2>Why Pi is Irrational</h2>
    <p>I just was wondering where Pi came from. If circumference = 2πr then that means pi is the circumference divided by the diameter. Why this relationship between the distance around and the distance across? I wondered if this would happen with other shapes like triangles. I couldn't prove any theorems, so I googled "is there a pi for triangles?" and this image came up. Apparently, pi is already calculated by using smaller and smaller triangles to simulate a circle. This is why pi is irrational. The triangles can never quite become a perfect circle. It's like infinitesimal calculus.

    So this whole difficulty comes from the fact that a circle is a concept. There are no perfect circles in nature, and if there was there would be no way to measure a curved line without using infinitesimal calculus to get ever-increasingly better estimations.
    
    There you have it, folks! Why is pi irrational? Because circles don't exist and are impossible to perfectly measure the perimeter because it is curved.
    
    Pi is a constant ratio dependent on an immeasurable quantity. Until we know how to rationalize curved lines, Pi will remain irrational. </p>

    <h2>The Purpose of Algorithms</h2>
    <code>This is not working because it has code in it.</code>    
    <div id="image5"></div>
    <h2>My Web Dev Methodology</h2>
    <p>Facebook created a View Library called React in 2013. They conveniently made a terminal command “create-react-app” that starts an application for you. If you say in the command line, “create-react-app codejoy”, it will create a new react application called codejoy. Then if you cd into the directory of codejoy and run “npm start” a localhost will open your app at 3000.



    This is an incredible head-start. It’s only a couple commands and you already have a working local website that is easily adjustable. It currently links to React’s homepage but you could easily redirect that link to your portfolio and make the app an advertisement.
    
    
    
    To recap:
    
    
    
    1) open your terminal
    
    2) cd to where you want your React app to go
    
    3) run “create-react-app exampleName” to create and name your React app
    
    4) cd into exampleName you chose and run “npm start”
    
    
    
    To further accelerate the development process, I have been using “Primitive CSS” which I copy and paste into my index.css file so everything is immediately reformatted. This means I can write normal html and always have a decent default style. It’s not super mobile responsive, but it accomplishes so much for just a quick copy and paste.
    
    
    
    5) Go here: https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive/css/main.css
    
    and just copy and paste all that code into your index.css, overwriting it.
    
    
    
    Now you’re ready to develop with React by making components. But what about when you’re ready to deploy? How will you get it online? Can you do it for free?
    
    
    
    Because React is technically a view library, it works well with single page applications or SPAs. SPAs are easier to deploy online because there are free services like github pages and netlify. I recommend Netlify because you get infinite pages, and random urls, or can pay for custom domain name if you want like I spent $10 to redirect my random url to maxjann.com
    
    
    
    In order to deploy conveniently and even continuously update, you have to use git. Git is a version control system to track your changes. What’s cool about it is that Netlify can access your github repositories and turn them into static webpages. It has bots that do the deployment for you, it even runs “npm run build” for you. All you do is specify which repo you want deployed.
    
    
    
    6) Use version control/ github
    
    7) Use netlify.com and choose repo
    
    8) Change url to custom domain if desired
    
    9) Now you have a working webpage and can immediately start sending it to people.
    
    
    
    create-react-app takes about 10 seconds to run. It would take me hours to do what it does manually, probably I couldn’t even do it. In comparison, setting up a django project to get to the point react is after create-react-app example and cd example npm start would take me about 15 minutes and deployment would take me about an hour on AWS or even Pythonanywhere.com with a 50% fail rate.
    
    
    
    That’s cutting time off of my start of creating web apps. Netlify cuts time off the end of the process. It takes virtually no time at all. The bots take about 15 - 30 seconds to make your github repo into a real webpage.
    
    
    
    When you combine the power of create-react-app in the beginning, as well as primitive css, with the power of Netlify free easy deployment from github, you have the ability to accomplish in 1 hour what would have taken days or been impossible to do otherwise.
    
    
    
    Primitive CSS essentially takes care of styling, takes it out of the equation. You can adjust it if you want, but it’s taken care of.
    
    
    
    Netlify takes care of deployment completely, as long as it’s a single page app, Netlify can handle it and since git is a normal part of development, netlify is not a nuisance.
    
    
    
    Even components can save ridiculous amounts of time. I can make an image component with certain methods or properties and then have different iterations of it so I don’t have to redo the logic for every button. 
    
    
    
    I don’t know advanced React yet but I feel good about my ability to process forms, run searches, and use an API. I could get better with posting to an API. It would be great if I could stay with SPAs on Netlify but have some sort of API I can post and pull from that way I can persist data and have users log back on.
    
    
    
    If that doesn’t work I’ll just add React to my Django Apps to improve the UI.
    
    
    
    I would say mobile-first responsive design is still my worst thing. The only time it’s felt good is with Bootstrap but that’s a template I edited without understanding. 
    
    
    
    Thank you React and Netlify, you’re making my job so much easier.
    
    
    
    It almost wouldn’t even be worth developing without these tools. It is crucial to my motivation to be able to get right to the good stuff, and be able to share it freely instantly. I made the site below on Tuesday, from start to finish, and had work.

    <h2>The Mandela Effect</h2>
    <p>As a child, we learn what symbols mean. The letter V means a phonetic sound we can use to combine with other sounds and make words which are also symbols with compounded meaning. There's nothing inherently V about the letter V other than our decision to make it so.

    I didn't even know the handicap symbol represented a person in a wheelchair. I just thought of it as another letter. An arbitrary shape of lines. I thought of it as a complicated G that stood for handicapped and I didn't think about why. One day it hit me super hard that the whole time, it was supposed to be representing a person in a wheelchair. Handicap is a broader category than just people with wheelchairs, which is likely where my mistake came from. This experience of realizing a symbol stood for something other than what I thought, has also happened to me with the VW logo, but this is where it gets highly complicated.
    
    I have a distinct memory of the VW logo being connected, so much so that I went through life thinking that was the symbol for VW, without realizing it contained a V and a W overlapped and that's what it stood for. I cut out the middle man. I associated the strange symbol with that car company, without seeing the V and W, just like how I associated the handicap sign with handicapped people, without ever seeing the wheelchair.
    
    Here's the weird part: I don't think I would have been able to miss the V and the W if the two were separated by a line. There's not enough subtlety for me to have an Ahah moment that I clearly remember having. It's the V. You know? The W is clear in both cases, but the V is much more noticeable by dividing where it ends and the W begins.
    
    Now, no such mistakes can be made. It's possible that even the handicap symbol has changed and become more obvious. I'm interested in making sense of the craziness. It's possible that I'm remembering things wrong or noticing the same thing differently now. But still, the handicap and VW thing both hit me so hard. The worst part about all of this is, that after I learned the VW symbol contained a V and a W and that's why it was the way it was, I started noticing the gap between the V and the W on their cars, but I thought this was the car company adjusting itself and modernizing it's logo to become more obvious to increase brand recognition or utilize more precise design. Like Staples adding a staple to one of their letters in their logo. How cute? That's a marketing decision. That's a smart choice. It wasn't there the whole time, right? But now, when you dig, the scary part is that these companies claim the logo has always been that way. It simply reminds me of 1984 and rewriting history to serve the present. A crude form of retrocausality.
    
    Let me paint a picture for you that I think makes more sense. A Mom and Dad shop opens up and they sell office supplies and call themselves, "Staples". They sell mostly staples, maybe only staples. The sign is painted by their daughter and just says, "Staples" with no staple fancily designed within the letters on the sign. The company does well and expands its locations and products. 20 years later, they are a dominant chain and opening up a new superstore and someone at corporate says, "Hey, let's put a staple in our L so it looks like a staple and it's all quaint." Brilliant idea. So now every store has a remodel, and all the signs go up with the new design. Still Staples, but now has a staple in the logo. This is how I envision the development of that sign, but now, we're supposed to believe that that's always been their logo. The implications for this are staggering:
    
    The ability to rewrite your company's history means scandals can be erased, and that company's always been the way it is now. Imagine you run a burger joint and it's discovered that your meat is foul. This would irreversibly damage your brand even if when discovered you switched to real meat. The damage is done. But, if you could rewrite history as if that never happened, then that's in your company's best interest. On a smaller scale, if you can throw in a nice twist on your logo, it might be better for you if customers believe it was always there.
    
    If you're king, it's beneficial for your subjects to believe you've always been king; that there is no other way, no escape.

    For practical minds --
    
    Let's say you have a new company but you can't decide what the name of it should be. You are deciding between Chic-fil-a, Chik-fil-a, and Chick-fil-a. So what do you do? You launch restaurants with all 3 names in different towns across the country. No commercials yet, You lower prices and rely on word of mouth. Then you measure the sales and reactions to the names and you ultimately decide Chick-fil-a makes the most sense. You have all the other spelling changed like nothing ever happened, and you start your ad campaign claiming you've always been what's actually been recently tested. In this scenario, I'm the guy in Westlake Village eating my Chic-fil-a sandwich for $3 and saying to myself, "They really should have a 'K' in the name, like chicken; that would make more sense." I remember that thought. I remember conversations with my friends about the name, joking around about how to pronounce it. Listen, there's no joke if they named it "Chick" . Only "Chic" allows for confusion. My memories of the name as confusing make no sense in the current context of the the name always having been "chick". So, that to me in the strange phenomenon of the Mandela Effect and the potential market explanation. It's like a focus group of the largest proportions. But I wouldn't throw out the parallel universes explanations or perhaps a combination of the two where somehow things are changing supernaturally either randomly or by design.
    
    If you're with me so far, which believe me I know you're not, I have noticed a pattern. Every change is either ominous or obvious. "Life is like a box of chocolates" becomes "life was like a box of chocolates" in Forest Gump. "We're gonna need a bigger boat" becomes "you're gonna need a bigger boat." "It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood" instead of "the neighborhood" which implies inclusion to all neighborhoods vs. exclusion from where it's nice. Those are the ominous ones. The obvious ones are the V and the W separating, or the Chic-fil-a becoming Chick-fil-et. Disclaimer: whether or not the changes are happening I'm interested in the implications of the changes if they did in fact happen.
